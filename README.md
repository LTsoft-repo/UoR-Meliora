# UoR-Melliora
Code Challenge from University of Rochester, School of Nursing. 

## Description
Write a program that counts from 1 to 50. 
- When the number is a multiple of 3, print `Nursing`. 
- When the number is a multiple of 7, print `Meliora`. 
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, print `Nursing Meliora`. 
- If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 7, just print the number.  

Use a separate project to provide the output. You may use any type of project / display / interface you feel would be interesting.
